# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
## Homework-Required
1.Recreated the logical cloud architeccture diagramm in Lucidcharts by following Andrew's video in which he went through the entire thing step-by-step(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6FDrI_tz0k&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=17). It came out pretty much one-to-one to the diagram shown during class. Here it is below : ![Arch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91217901/219041562-3090fe50-6acb-4973-b5c8-aeee65ae6466.png)

## Homework Challenges 
Haven't managed to touch the challenges or the stretch goals for week-0 but I do plan on getting all of themm done over the weekend (18th-19th Feb ,2023). I found the CI/CD pipeline to be particularly interesting as well as the security related challenge. I'll be populating this portion as soon as I get them done.
